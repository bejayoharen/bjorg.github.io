I am an Engineering leader who most recently worked as SVP Engineering at GIPHY. GIPHY was purchased in 2020 by Meta and 2023 by Shutterstock. At GIPHY, I grew, nurtured and lead the engineering team, and worked closely with other leaders.

Before working at GIPHY and becoming a manager, I made a decent living developing software as a contractor. Almost all this work involved digital audio. My claim to fame was probably

which was the first digital audio editor that could record, mix and apply effects in a web browser, but I worked on other interesting things, too.

Throughout my career, I learned a lot about the nuances of digital audio, writing software for digital audio processing, managing teams, and running an engineering department.
