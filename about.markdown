I am an Engineering leader who most recently worked as SVP Engineering at GIPHY. GIPHY serves about 10 billion pieces of content per day to partners including Meta, TikTok and more. It was purchased in 2020 by Meta and 2023. At GIPHY, I grew, nurtured and lead the engineering team.

Before working at GIPHY and becoming a manager, I made a decent living developing software as a contractor. Almost all this work involved digital audio. My claim to fame was probably

which was the first digital audio editor that could record, mix and apply effects in a web browser, but I worked on other interesting things, too.

Throughout my career, I learned a lot about the nuances of digital audio, writing software for digital audio processing, managing teams, and running an engineering department.
