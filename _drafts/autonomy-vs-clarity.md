Over the years I've gone back and forth about what is the right approach to management and leadership -- should you give your team goals and the autonomy (and trust) to develop solutions themselves, or should you give them specific objectives and direct the team in a hands-on way? Should you come to the table with a strong point of view and get as much buy-in as you can, or build consensus by working with all stakeholders to come up with a plan?

I've gone back and forth on these questions over the years only to realize the obvious, that a good leader has a toolkit of different approaches and knows which to apply when.

# Leading with autonomy

The most common leadership styles I hear talked about these days focus on giving clear goals and then trusting teams to achieve them. Some people take this so far that they use an [inverted org chart](https://www.organice.app/blog/inverted-org-chart-when-to-use-and-how-to-make-it), with leaders at the bottom. The upside-down org chart highlights who is closest to the work, and may be used as a visual signal to remind people that the leaders are [servants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) in this style.

Using this principle to organize your company, you start with top-level goals (eg increase revenue 15%), and find smaller "sub-goals" that ladder up to the main goal (eg. increase customer retention and increase number of new customers). Then assign the sub-goals to departments, sub-sub-goals to teams, and so on. The [North Star Framework](https://amplitude.com/books/north-star/about-north-star-framework) is a formal process based on this very idea.

Personally, I like thinking of giving autonomy as the default way an org should work. A lot of problems can be broken down into sub-problems and tackled independently without too much coordination. I've found this style of management works great for empowering teams to solve problems and is very motivating.

There are, however, lots of ways this style can go wrong. Some problems don't break down neatly into sub-problems and require coordination of the multiple teams or even the whole company. While working at GIPHY, there were times when the CEO or GM had to be very specific about sequencing work across teams.

In the worst case, I've seen CEOs use this leadership style as an excuse to do practically no work themselves. Leaders who lean too heavily on this style are the ones who give unreasonable goals, which they say is "to inspire you", or "get you to think big". These CEOs hope the team figures it out, and lay people off when they don't. The failure here is not realizing that sometimes achieving big goals requires lots of coordination.

# Leading with involvement

Instead of giving autonomy, some leaders focus on giving clarity, and involving themselves deeply in many decisions. Some people call this "[founder mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html)".

Of course there's a limit to how much a leader can be involved in each decision, so it's important to realize that you need to think carefully about how to scale this style of leadership. As you grow, you need to decide which decisions you need need to be involved in, and still have a system for letting the org make other decisions.

# Leading with policy

It may not feel like leadership to everyone, but writing clear policies gives your team direction about how to make decisions. Writing careful policies is an opportunity to shape decisions without having to be personally involved in every decision. It can also be helpful in driving clarity for yourself -- the rules you lay out for others should be the same you use for yourself, after all.

Leading with policy works best for decisions that are repeated, such as hiring, and making small technical or product decisions, but as a company grows there are more and more fo those, so it becomes more and more helpful to have policies.

A good policy is explicit about when escalations should and should not happen, so when you decide which decisions you want to be involved in, it's helpful to make that explicit in policies.

Obviously, you can't make a policy to cover every possible situation, so they are best used for types of situations that come up a lot.

# Leading with consensus

The easiest way to get buy-in is to make sure everyone contributes and agrees with the decision. The kind of deep buy-in that comes from this can be extremely valuable: everyone feels like they contributed to the targets and everyone feels motivated to contribute.

I like to use consensus when working with a single (not too big) team, because I want everyone working hard
