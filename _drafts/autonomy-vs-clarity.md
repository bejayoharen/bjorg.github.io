Over the years I've gone back and forth about what is the right approach to management and leadership -- should you give your team the autonomy and trust to develop solutions themselves, or should you give them specific objectives and direct the team in a hands-on way? Should you come to the table with a strong point of view and get as much buy-in as you can, or build consensus by working with all stakeholders to come up with a plan?

Mulling these questions over eventually lead me to the obvious conclusion, that a good leader has a toolkit of different approaches and knows which to apply when. Two very important factors to take into account when making this decision are 1. how much autonomy each approach allows the team to have, and 2. how much clarity it gives them about what they need to do.

# Leadership by autonomy

### What it is
The most common leadership styles I hear talked about these days focuses on giving goals and then trusting teams to figure out how to achieve them. Of course there needs to be clarity on a few points -- eg what the goals are -- for the teams to be able to figure out the details themselves and work autonomously. I group these leadership styles together and call it "leadership by autonomy" because that's what it emphasizes.

Some people take this style of leadership so far that they use different org charts. Eg, the [inverted org chart](https://www.organice.app/blog/inverted-org-chart-when-to-use-and-how-to-make-it), with leaders at the bottom, may be used as a visual signal to remind people that the [leaders are servants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) of the ICs and that the ICs have the most context and best positioned to make decisions. I think inverting the org chart is more useful as a gimmick to get people thinking different about everyone's roles than anything else, but it does show how far people take this idea.

A more practical approach might be the [North Star Framework](https://amplitude.com/books/north-star/about-north-star-framework), which aims to give autonomy to teams and individuals by taking top-level goals and breaking them down. For example you might start with a top-level goals such as increasing revenue by 15%. Then you break the goal into sub goals (eg increase customer retention by 15% and increase number of new customers by 10%). The sub-goals can be further broken down until they reach individuals.

### When to use it

I like thinking of leadership by autonomy as the default way an org should work. For the huge set of problems that can be broken down into sub-problems and tackled independently without too much coordination, this technique is very powerful. This style works great for empowering teams to solve problems, which is very motivating. Use this leadership style to use your team's strengths to break down and solve complex problems.

### Pitfalls

Not all problems break down neatly into sub-problems and instead require coordination of multiple teams or even the whole company. That doesn't mean this style doesn't work, it just means don't use it for problems that require coordinated effort or specific cross-team outcomes to achieve.

# Leadership by involvement

### What it is
Instead of giving autonomy, some leaders focus more of their time on involving themselves deeply in many decisions. Some people call this "[founder mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html)", although I'm not sure that term has a clearly agreed-upon definition.

### When to use it

When I think of a highly involved and highly effective leader, they remain experts in their products, they work with employees at every level of the org, and are invested in details. Leaders who deeply understand their product and the details of it (eg founders) can be highly effective when engaging employees throughout the org in many aspects of decision making.

I also think it's important that as you remain involved, you never give the impression of taking over. You are reducing autonomy this way, and that only works if people have confidence in you and feel like their involvement is at least collaborative.

### Pitfalls

Of course there's a limit to how many decisions a single leader can be involved in, so it's important to realize that you need to think carefully about how to scale this style of leadership. As you grow, you need to decide which decisions you need need to be involved in, and still have a system for letting the org make other decisions without you.[^orgdesign]

Furthermore, if you get too involved in areas where someone perfectly competent is in place already, this can feel like micromanaging. Decide carefully if you need to be deeply involved or simply provide clarity on the plan and expectations.

If you don't know the details well, this kind of management can be the worst -- you are now a micromanaging boss who doesn't understand the details. Using this style when you are new to a company or a project is generally a disaster.

# Leadership by policy

### What it is

Writing careful policies is an opportunity to shape decisions without having to be personally involved in each of those decisions. It can also be helpful in driving clarity for yourself -- the rules you lay out for others should be the same you use for yourself, after all.

### When to use it

Leading with policy works best for decisions that are repeated, such as hiring, and making small technical or product decisions. As a company grows there are more and more of those kinds of decisions, so it becomes more and more helpful to have well-written policies.

### Pitfalls

Too much leadership with policy (especially when overly nuanced, detailed or confusing) can make a company feel inflexible and bureaucratic. When big companies try to cover too many cases with policy and complex approval processes, just navigating policy can start to soak up everyone's time. Good policy is clear and simple, and has flexibility to cover a most cases.

A good policy is also explicit about when escalations should and should not happen (ie when someone higher up needs to involved in the decision), so be sure to put that in your policies, too.

# Leadership by conviction

Sometimes a problem requires more than just involvement -- it requires a top-down decision. This is where conviction comes in. When leading by conviction, you need to make a decision and do your best to get everyone to buy into it.

Many decisions such as changes in strategy or a reorg, may need to be made this way. However, because of how little autonomy this method gives the people you manage, it can lead to resentment, and having been on the receiving end of poorly executed leadership by conviction, I can attest that it can be a frustrating experience.

The only way this method works is if you are able to fully absorb all the info needed to make the decision yourself, otherwise you will make the decision incorrectly. Worse, someone who knows something you don't will know you are making the wrong decision and will loose confidence in you.

Once you've made the right decision, you need to get buy-in. I like to do this by meeting with everyone one-on-one (in order from the most impacted to the least) and genuinely considering their feedback. If this isn't possible, be ready for the repercussions of upsetting someone. I've heard stories of people walking out or even quitting on the spot when this goes wrong.

# Leadership by consensus

Sometimes you need to make a coordinated decision and can't afford the risks of leadership by conviction. Or perhaps no one person has all the context needed to make the right decision. In these cases, you need to drive consensus.

While it might seem like a slow process,[^slow] the kind of deep buy-in that comes from a true consensus can be extremely valuable: everyone feels like they contributed to the targets and everyone feels motivated to contribute. Moreover, getting buy-in when leading from conviction can sometimes take even more time.

I like to use consensus when working with a single (not too big) team, because I want everyone motivated and fully bought in. I also like to use it when a decision can't be made by one person alone.


# Notes

[^orgdesign]: Dan Hockenmaier [writes](https://www.danhock.co/p/designing-an-org-for-founder-mode): "founder mode organizations maximize the number of decisions made by the founder, up to the limits of their ability to make better or faster decisions." I think it's important to figure out how you decide what to decide.
[^slow]: Will Larson [argues](https://lethain.com/developing-leadership-styles/) that, "Consensus has a reputation for being slow, but I think that’s an overstated concern. In situations where no one has the entire relevant context, there’s no particularly quick solution to making a robust decision."
