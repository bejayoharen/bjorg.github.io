Over the years I've gone back and forth about what is the right approach to management and leadership -- should you give your team the autonomy and trust to develop solutions themselves, or should you give them specific objectives and direct the team in a hands-on way? Should you come to the table with a strong point of view and get as much buy-in as you can, or build consensus by working with all stakeholders to come up with a plan?

Mulling these questions over eventually lead me to the obvious conclusion, that a good leader has a toolkit of different approaches and knows which to apply when. Two very important factors are how much autonomy each approach allows the team to have and how much clarity it gives them about what they need to do, especially since it's hard to give your team a lot of clarity and a lot of autonomy.

# Leadership by autonomy

The most common leadership styles I hear talked about these days focuses on giving goals and then trusting teams to figure out how to achieve them. Of course there needs to be clarity on a few points -- eg what the goals are -- for the teams to be able to figure out the details themselves and work autonomously.

Some people take this style of leadership so far that they use an [inverted org chart](https://www.organice.app/blog/inverted-org-chart-when-to-use-and-how-to-make-it), with leaders at the bottom. The upside-down org chart highlights who is closest to the work, and may be used as a visual signal to remind people that the [leaders are servants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) of the ICs and not the other way around.

Using this principle to organize your company, you start with top-level goals (eg increase revenue 15%), and find smaller "sub-goals" that ladder up to the top-level goal (eg. increase customer retention and increase number of new customers). The sub-goals are assigned to teams and then broken down further and assigned to sub-teams, and so on, until you reach individuals. The [North Star Framework](https://amplitude.com/books/north-star/about-north-star-framework) is a formal process based on this idea.

Personally, I like thinking of giving autonomy as the default way an org should work. A lot of problems can be broken down into sub-problems and tackled independently without too much coordination, and doing so works great for empowering teams to solve problems, all of which is very motivating.

There are, however, lots of ways this style can go wrong. Some problems don't break down neatly into sub-problems and require coordination of the multiple teams or even the whole company. In the worst case, I've seen CEOs use this leadership style as an excuse to do practically no work themselves. Leaders who lean too heavily on this style are the ones who give goals without any reasonable way of believing those goals can be met. They say these goals are "to inspire you", or "get you to think big". These CEOs hope the team figures out the details, and lays people off when they inevitably don't. The failure here is not giving the team too much autonomy, but that the only person with the leverage to make a coordinated strategic change doesn't realize it's their job to do so. That doesn't mean this style doesn't work, it just means don't use it for everything.

# Leadership by involvement

Instead of giving autonomy, some leaders focus more of their time on giving clarity, and involving themselves deeply in many decisions. Some people call this "[founder mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html)", although I'm not sure that term has a clearly agreed-upon definition.

When I think of a highly involved and highly effective leader, they remain experts in their products, they work with employees at every level of the org, and are invested in details.

Of course there's a limit to how many decisions a single leader can be involved in, so it's important to realize that you need to think carefully about how to scale this style of leadership. As you grow, you need to decide which decisions you need need to be involved in, and still have a system for letting the org make other decisions without you.[^orgdesign]

# Leadership by policy

It may not feel like leadership to everyone, but writing clear policies gives your team direction about how to make decisions, and is therefore an important tool to have at your disposal. Writing careful policies is an opportunity to shape decisions without having to be personally involved in each of those decisions. It can also be helpful in driving clarity for yourself -- the rules you lay out for others should be the same you use for yourself, after all.

Leading with policy works best for decisions that are repeated, such as hiring, and making small technical or product decisions, but as a company grows there are more and more of those, so it becomes more and more helpful to have policies.

This is why big companies can feel inflexible and bureaucratic, too: when big companies try to cover too many cases with policy and complex approval processes just navigating policy can start to soak up everyone's time. But good policy is clear and simple. 

A good policy is also explicit about when escalations should and should not happen, so be sure to put that in your policies, too.

# Leadership by conviction

Sometimes a problem requires more than just involvement -- it requires a top-down decision. This is where conviction comes in. When leading by conviction, you need to make a decision and do your best to get everyone to buy into it.

Many decisions such as changes in strategy or a reorg, may need to be made this way. However, because of how little autonomy this method gives the people you manage, it can lead to resentment, and having been on the receiving end of poorly executed leadership by conviction, I can attest that it can be a frustrating experience.

The only way this method works is if you are able to fully absorb all the info needed to make the decision yourself, otherwise you will make the decision incorrectly. Worse, someone who knows something you don't will know you are making the wrong decision and resent it.

Once you've made the right decision, you need to get buy-in. I like to do this by meeting with everyone one-on-one (in order from the most impacted to the least) and genuinely considering their feedback. If this isn't possible, be ready for the repercussions of upsetting someone. I've heard stories of people walking out or even quitting on the spot when this goes wrong.

# Leadership by consensus

Sometimes you need to make a top-down decision and can't afford the risks of leadership by conviction. Or perhaps no one person has all the context needed to make the right decision. In these cases, you need to drive consensus.

While it might seem like a slow process,[^slow] the kind of deep buy-in that comes from a true consensus can be extremely valuable: everyone feels like they contributed to the targets and everyone feels motivated to contribute. Moreover, getting buy-in when leading from conviction can sometimes take even more time.

I like to use consensus when working with a single (not too big) team, because I want everyone motivated and fully bought in. I also like to use it when a decision can't be made by one person alone.


# Notes

[^orgdesign]: Dan Hockenmaier [writes](https://www.danhock.co/p/designing-an-org-for-founder-mode): "founder mode organizations maximize the number of decisions made by the founder, up to the limits of their ability to make better or faster decisions." I think it's important to figure out how you decide what to decide.
[^slow]: Will Larson [argues](https://lethain.com/developing-leadership-styles/) that, "Consensus has a reputation for being slow, but I think that’s an overstated concern. In situations where no one has the entire relevant context, there’s no particularly quick solution to making a robust decision."
