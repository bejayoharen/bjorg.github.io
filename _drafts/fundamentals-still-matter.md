If you happen to be the CEO of a company that makes foundation LLMs, this article may not apply to you. Your company is not selling your current business model as much as you are selling a dream that your models will be the way all work is done in the future.

For the rest of us, we still need to sell a business model, and to do that, we still need to rely on fundamental that show how we can make money and how we can grow.

# How Valuations Work

To oversimplify: valuations of public companies are usually based on how much money the company is expected to make in the future. Often, investors estimate this based on how much money the company makes now.[^pe] Emotions and guesswork play a role as well: if the company is expected to grow, investors might feel the company is worth more, which is why tech companies tend to trade for more money than they otherwise would based on their earnings.[^FANG]

For late-stage startups, the calculation is roughly the same, but predictions about the future play a more important role. After all, a late stage startup asking for a round of investment is expected to use the investment money to grow and earn an outsized return.

For early stage startups with little revenue, it's all about predicting the future, but some amount of revenue can help validate your predictions by showing that someone is willing to pay for your product.[^2]

# Is big AI overvalued?

With that logic, big AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic would seem extremely overvalued (The Economist goes so far as to call it ["verging on the unhinged"](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/06/25/ai-valuations-are-verging-on-the-unhinged)). These companies simply can't justify their valuations based on current revenues -- instead they use the promise of continued AI breakthroughs (that only they can achieve) to justify these valuations.

They might be right that super-intelligence is around the corner, but regardless, these companies are outside the realm of how valuations normally work for a company at their stage -- at least outside of a bubble.

# For the rest of us, fundamentals still matter most

For the rest of us, it's important not to be taken in by this kind of thinking. Despite the claim like ["ARR is Dead"](https://www.onlycfo.io/p/yes-arr-is-dead)[^arr], companies that are not AI Giants still need to focus on the fundamentals.

What are the fundamentals? These include basic metrics like ARR, churn rate. You might wonder why I've left out Profit or EBITDA.

## Footnotes

[^pe]: The "Price/Earnings Ratio" is the number you'll for when evaluating a company this way. Savvy investors will discount future earnings because they are worth less the further in the future they are, so a company expected to earn a lot in the distant future should be worth less than a company that is expected to make lots of money in the near future.

[^FANG]: You may not believe in the growth potential of companies like Netflix, Microsoft, Google and Meta, but the market seems to think they still have room to grow.

[^2]: Not that long ago, consumer apps didn't even need revenue to earn investment at this stage -- they just needed to show that they could engage and retain users. The idea was that once you had engaged users you could find a way to make money off them.

[^arr]: Of course it's a bit of a click-bait-y title. The article itself is a nicely nuanced article about how changing market conditions mean we need to rethink exactly which metric we use to track the success of our business.
