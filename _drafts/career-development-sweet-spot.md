In [my last blog post](/management/secret-to-getting-promoted/), I talked about how to get promoted. This time, it's time to think a bit about how career development fits in with your own work satisfaction.

Let’s say you want to get better at Python. If your goal is to be more satisfied in your work and enjoy the process of putting a new programming language to use, then getting better at Python might be a worthy thing to focus on. If the company needs more Python expertise or it helps you tackle bigger projects in some way, improving your Python skills may even help your career.

But what if your company doesn't even use Python, or doesn't need deeper expertise? Should you bother with developing your Python skills? That depends on what makes you happier: maybe Python is just something you are too excited about to not spend some time learning it. I've been there: sometimes a technology is so interested and so exciting, I don't particularly care what it does for me professionally. But if pushing your career forward is an important goal to you, think about other projects. 

There are things that you want to do to make yourself happy and grow as an individual, and there are things the company needs you to do. The sweet spot is where those overlap, so you can develop personally *and* professionally. However, overlap doesn’t always exist – sometimes what you want or the company needs is too narrow. The broader your personal development goals are and the more flexible you are about them, the more likely you are to find overlap.

# Narrow interests

Some engineers, however, have very narrow interests, which don't overlap much with the company needs. That's okay, too, as long as they are thoughtful about it, and make a conscious decision to de-prioritize career growth. I've seen many engineers sacrifice high-paced career growth so they can kick around side projects, and they are typically very happy with the choice. The company is happy too as long as the side project remains a side project and doesn't interfere with the important work the company needs from them.

I've also seen engineers, however, who convince themselves that a personal interest has outsized value to the company, when really it's just something they think is cool. If not nipped in the bud,[^bud] this leads to a bad review where their manager can't understand what they've been wasting their time on, and the report can't understand why they aren't appreciated. A vicious cycle can emerge: the report keeps trying to prove themselves, but keep getting bad feedback. This is a recipe for burnout.

The solution is to recognize that what the company needs is not flexible. Start with that, and figure out how you can tune your interests to the company, rather than starting with your wants and trying to tune the company's needs to you. If you start with company needs first, and then figure out how you can make an impact, you will see more clearly. If you try to figure out how to make an impact without deeply understanding the needs of the company, you will probably spend some time working on something sub-optimal.[^fool]

# Finding the sweet spot

Early in my own career, I had very narrow interests in scientific computing and [digital audio](http://localhost:4000/categories/#audio), so instead of getting a job at a company where I’d be asked to do things that had nothing to do with my interests, I worked as a contractor and only took on audio projects. As time went on, my interests grew much more flexible and my ambition increased, so I got a normal job and focused on the things that would get me promoted. Still, whenever I see an opportunity to do something that will satisfy something personal and professional, I go for it, and I've been known to make room for things that don't help my career at all -- it's always good to give your personal interests a little attention now and again.

# Notes

[^bud]: I've seen people not nip this in the bud. When you are really excited about something, no one wants to be the buzzkill who tells you it's a waste of time.

[^fool]: If you think you understand the needs of the company and come to the unlikely conclusion that your narrow interest is exactly what the company needs, you are probably fooling yourself and don't actually understand the needs of the company.
