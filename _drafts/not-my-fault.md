# "Not my fault"

Some people think gaining trust means convincing their boss that everything is going smoothly. Maybe in some dysfunctional orgs “don’t tell your boss about things going wrong” is good advice, I for one would rather hear about the problems my reports are having before it's too late to do anything. Even more important, I want to know they are going to resolve it. I like my reports to come prepared with a solution, or at least be open to working out a solution with my help. Finding out about a problem later and having to mop it up myself, on the other hand, tells me I can't trust them with the next project.

Many people complain about being punished at work for things that are out of their control. "It wasn't my fault, but I still got the blame," they might say. While this certainly happens, the problem can often be mitigated by telling your manager about the issue as soon as you spot it: "Angie just told me her team might not have the endpoints we need for the May deadline. We need those endpoints to complete our work on time. How do you suggest I handle this?" By communicating the issue early, you are not only creating more opportunity to resolve the issue, but you are also preventing the narrative from becoming one of your failure.
