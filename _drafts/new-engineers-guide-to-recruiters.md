If you’ve worked in tech, you’ve probably had some experience with recruiters. Even in bear markets most of us get messages from recruiters. Let’s talk about how to make the most of these experiences.

Some day, you may need someone who can help you connect with a job, or, if you become a manager, you might want their help hiring people. Recruiters can be great for both those situations — but only the good ones.

# Types of recruiters

Straight-up scammers aside (more below), there are two kinds of recruiters who will reach out to you: the ones who are good at their jobs and the rest. The good ones have looked at your profile and made some rough assessment about your fit for a particular job. If a recruiter is messaging you about a role that has little to no correlation to what you have on your linkedin profile, ignore them. If the recruiter doesn’t personalize the message, or targets you for a Sysadmin or IT job when you are a developer, go ahead and mark that message as spam.

But if a reasonably experienced person might spend two minutes on your profile and think you are a good fit for a particular role, it’s worth taking a moment to respond.

# How recruiters work

At least in the US, professional recruiters get paid a commission when they place someone. The commission typically amounts to about one month of the salary of the person who’s hired.

This system incentivizes recruiters to fill the position. A bad recruiter pushes to get a fit as soon as possible with as little work on their part as possible. A good recruiter, on the other hand, meets with the hiring manager and works to understands what the company is looking for. Then they do some pre-vetting so they pass people along only if they think there's a reasonable chance of a fit.

A classic strategy recruiters use is to pass along 3 matches that vary along some axis, like experience. This can mean a recruiter reaching out to you is less interested in placing you and more interested in using you as a gauge with the employer about what makes a good fit. This is annoying, but usually won’t result in too much of your time wasted.

One thing I like about working with recruiters, is that they can help keep moving things along and can provide feedback you wouldn't get directly from an employer. Sometimes they even have an inside scoop, because they've had conversations with the decision-makers, so if they say "the company is really looking for someone who XXX" make a mental note because it's likely something a hiring manager told them and may not be on the JD.

# How to engage with recruiters

Once a recruiter reaches out to you and you’ve decided they seem like they might be one of the good ones, you probably will want to know more about the role. Keep in mind that it's normal for recruiters to hide some details, like who the company is, until they actually talk to you (this is to protect their commission). It's normal for them to be a bit cagey at first about some details.

However, they should be able to answer some basic questions, like the industry, location, core requirements, size/stage of the company, title, and compensation range. If they send a JD and I'm not a perfect fit, I take this moment to say something like "It sounds interesting but I don't have experience in BLAH. Is that a hard requirement for the job?" If it IS a core requirement, you've saved everyone a lot of time. If the answer it isn't, you've been honest and earned a little trust. Sometimes these innocuous questions can lead to answers that indicate that the recruiter and the hiring manager are not on the same page.

If a recruiter reaches out with something that’s in the right neighborhood of what you are looking for but not something you would consider, it’s fine to politely decline.[^1]

# Identifying scams

Because recruiters are paid by the hiring company, they should never ask you for money. If they do, it’s a sure sign of a scam. Moreover, since they aren’t the ones hiring and paying you, they’ll never ask for too much personal info like your social security number. If you are in software development, you probably have a good spidey sense for when something is a scam, but just in case, here are some signs that the recruiter reaching out may be a scammer (it’s similar to any other list for identifying scammers):

* There’s a strange urgency (“contact us now if interested, we’ve already got lots of candidates!”)
* The message comes via a strange channel (eg text message or facebook)
* Asking for money or personal info, like your social security number. (as mentioned earlier, you will never pay a recruiter if you are the one being recruited)

Of course you'll have to share your social security number with the hiring company when you accept, but never share anything like that with a recruiter.

# Notes

[^1]: You can say something like: "I don't think that's a good match for me because XXX, but please keep me in mind for future opportunities that are more XXX". "I think I'm going to pass on this one because XXX, but I appreciate you reaching out." "thanks for thinking of me, but at the moment I need XXX" or even “sounds like an exciting role, but at the moment I’m quite happy where I am and I’m not looking.” A good recruiter will say something like “thanks for letting me know, let’s stay in touch in case something that’s a better fit comes up!”
