Unlike most jobs, an engineering leader usually needs to make their own plans. While someone might onboard you to the systems and so on, figuring out how to be effective is up to you. It's especially important to start off right because many people will be watching you carefully. A major misstep early on can be especially difficult to overcome.

This document is a simple plan you can bring to a new engineering leadership position to help set you off in the right direction. Of course every situation is different, and you'll be in a particularly tricky place if there are any immediate fires that need to be put out, so take this document and be prepared to adapt it for your new environment.

# Goals of the first 30 days

The two most important things you can do in your first 30 days are establish trust and understand how the business operates. Building trust takes time, but the foundations can be built quickly by listening, reflecting back what you hear, and asking thoughtful questions. This is a good time to find out what already is and isn’t working at the company, what problems might need to be addressed quickly, and ensure that you understand what the expectations are for your role.

Understanding how the business operates can be challenging: there may be written documentation you can read through, but in most organizations there’s usually some important unwritten rules as well.

# Tactics

How do you accomplish all that in just 30 days? Here are some specific tactics to help get you there.

## Establish a communication cadence
- [ ] **Setup regular 1:1s with reports, peers and leaders**. Follow company guidelines or use these recommended starting places:
  - [ ] Your superior(s). Weekly, if possible.
  - [ ] Your peers. Weekly.
  - [ ] Counterparts in other departments. Biweekly.
  - [ ] 1:1 with your direct reports. Weekly.
  - [ ] 1:1 with your skip levels. Monthly.
  - [ ] Team Leaders. Weekly.
  - [ ] All-hands. Quarterly. (Plan the first one as soon as you can and use it to introduce yourself)
  - [ ] Setup regular leadership and all-hands meetings you are responsible for.
- [ ] **Weekly email to your superior(s) and/or peers**. Even if the company has an update system in place, consider setting up a weekly email to your superior(s) and/or peers. This should be a few bullet points including: 1) What you accomplished, 2) what you are working on. 3) What's challenging you and how you plan to approach it. 4) anything you are blocked on or need approval or feedback on.[^1] (this is a good opportunity to ask for advice.

## Review the following information and processes:

    <figcaption>Building trust takes time, but start building the foundations as soon as you can.</figcaption>
</figure>
- [ ] **On-call rotation, and incident response process**. What does a typical event look like? How long does it take to resolve? Are the resolutions satisfactory and do the help prevent future issues? Are alerts tuned when they turn out to be too noisy or too insensitive?
- [ ] **Systems architecture**. How does the code work / what services are there? How is it hosted? Where are the bottlenecks? Where are the SPFs? What are the uptime requirements for each part? Where is the tech debt?
- [ ] **Technical documentation**. How up to date is it? How complete is it? Can you find what you need?
- [ ] **Budget**. Where is money spent? Which items seem like too much? Which items could be reduced, or need more explanation? What’s the volatility of expenditures? Are there surprises that shouldn’t happen? Where might there be budget flexibility?
- [ ] **Code repositories**. How is the code is broken into repos? What are the PR policies are in place?
- [ ] **Integration and deployment pipeline**. Can teams test and deploy changes easily and with low risk?
- [ ] **Observability and Analytics**. How do teams get the data they need? Can you pull the critical KPIs yourself?
- [ ] **Documentation**. Where does it live? how up to date is it? Do the existing templates need review?
- [ ] **Testing**. Is there unit, integration, end to end and smoke testing? What’s the coverage like? Are there good policies in place to promote good testing practices (eg are tests written whenever a bug is found?). Does the team have the testing environments they need (eg, local, development, staging)?
- [ ] **Product Development Process**. How does planning and roadmapping work? How do the teams operate (scrum, kanban, etc)? Do they do regular retros? Does the ticketing system and ticketing policies match the needs of the teams and organization? Does the team celebrate wins? Is the workload steady and sustainable?
- [ ] **Compensation and titles**. Are people compensated and leveled correctly? Is there a formal title ladder in place? Has it been implemented fairly?
- [ ] **Employee Lifecycle**. How are new employees interviewed, hired, promoted and onboarded? Is retention a problem or a strength? What do exit interviews tell you?
- [ ] **Previous reviews**. Going over reviews is useful not just for understanding people’s strengths and weaknesses, and ensuring that levels and comp are correct, but also for ensuring that good feedback mechanisms are in place.
- [ ] **Company mission, goals and strategy**. Read and understand the company's strategy, values, and goals.
- [ ] **Security**. Are the systems protected appropriately? Are VPNs enforced? Is there a proper system for removing access? What is the vulnerable surface area of the system?
- [ ] **Disaster recovery**. Are there sufficient backups in place? Can the entire system be rebuilt? Are the backups secure?

## Observe teams in action

Sit in on a few meetings.

- [ ] **Regular team meetings** (Planning, standup, retro)
- [ ] **Sales/partnership** meeting
- [ ] **Interviews/hiring** planning, as well as some actual interviews.

Things to look out for at all these meetings:
* How are attitudes? Are there motivation or morale issues? Is the workload sustainable? Are people eager to help each other? Do people follow up on their commitments? How are problems communicated? Do people naturally understand their goals and priorities, or is that more of a centralized effort?
* Are there communication or prioritization issues with engineering and other teams? Are the needs of different departments understood by each other? Are there common roadblocks? Does someone take charge of diffuse or distributed problems?

# What you should have accomplished

</figure>

By doing the above steps, you should accomplish all of the following. If not, take extra care to make sure that you accomplish these goals in some other way:

- [ ] **Understand why you were hired**, what success criteria you'll be judged by and if there are any immediate fires that need to be put out. What are the challenges you are expected to overcome? What improvements can you make?
- [ ] **Build trust** with all parties.
- [ ] **Understand the business**, including the complete customer acquisition funnel and customer life-cycle. When and how do customers interact with different parts of your business?
- [ ] **Understand the budget**. How is money spent? What is and is not flexible?
- [ ] **Understand organizational inertia**. How does the organization manage change? Where is it resistant to change? What kinds of processes are in place for change already? What kinds of change does the organization likely push back against? Are there existing processes like roadmap reviews that you can piggyback other changes onto?
- [ ] **Understand the org structure and decision-making process**, both formal and informal.
- [ ] **Identify key issues**, and have a rough diagnosis of their causes.
- [ ] **Understand the information hierarchy**. How do you find critical documentation? What is the status of that documentation (i.e. what can be expected to be out of date)? Who are the experts?
- [ ] **Understand critical metrics**. What metrics does the business live and breathe by? How do you pull those metrics yourself?
- [ ] **Familiarize yourself with key technologies**. What technologies are in use, and which of those do you need to get up to date on.
- [ ] **Understand business goals and current strategy**. What does the business need to accomplish? How do existing leaders expect the business to change, and what your role is in making that change happen?
- [ ] **Understand the critical KPIs**. What metrics does the business live and breathe by? How do you pull those metrics yourself?
- [ ] **Fill in any knowledge gaps**. (such as technologies you aren't familiar with)


# Next steps: developing a strategy

From here, you should be on your way to ensuring you can successfully navigate the org, and get the information you need. With the trust you've established, you should be able to steer the organization in the right direction. As you continue gathering information, you should start to develop a picture of what needs to be improved, and what can stay the same. You may spot problems or opportunities for improvement which can form the first part of your strategy moving forward.

In a [previous post](/management/effective-strategy/), I stated that the first step in an effective strategy is an accurate diagnosis, and that’s what you should be developing in your first 30 days. By observing the company in action and collecting data before taking action, you can avoid the all-too-common “I’m going to make these changes because that's how we did it at my last company.”
