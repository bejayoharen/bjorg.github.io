I’m not usually one to push the “one weird trick” headline, but, in the case of getting promoted, I think there is one thing that should be central to the conversation, yet I never hear others talk about it. I’m talking about building trust. You can only get promoted if the organization trusts you to do the job they are promoting you into.[^organization]

I’ve heard from lawyers that in order to win over juries (and even judges) it's best to first make an emotional appeal and then supply sufficient evidence to allow the jury to feel justified in their decision. The strategy works because people tend to make decisions based on emotions, not logic, and then fill in the logical justifications for their decisions later. The same thing applies in promotions: first you need to win emotionally, and then supply the proof. In this case, the emotion you must win on is trust.

# Gaining trust

Building trust usually means convincing the organization that you can tackle more impactful projects. This might mean taking on bigger projects, or it might mean creating more visibility for the work you do, or it might mean something else, like taking on fewer projects but getting them done better.

The common advice you hear about getting promoted may be helpful, but only if it helps build trust. For example, you might hear “stay out of office politics” and also, somewhat in contradiction, “make sure your work is visible”. If no one knows who you are and what you’ve accomplished, the latter is probably the advice to follow, and you probably need to face office politics to get seen. If people see your great work, but you’re perceived as getting in other people’s way, staying in your lane and out of office politics might be better advice. Knowing which advice to take depends on the situation.

Some people think gaining trust means convincing your boss that everything is always going smoothly. Maybe in some dysfunctional orgs “don’t tell your boss about things going wrong” is good advice, but as a manager, I always want to hear about the problems my reports are having. Of course, I also listen out for things like “here’s what I’m doing about it”. Knowing my report has a plan builds trust. Finding out about a problem later and having to mop it up myself does not.

I worked at a company once where the product team was responsible for planning. They would often present a mostly completed plan to engineering and ask for our feedback. What they really wanted, though, was for us to rubber stamp it. Instead, I would often ask questions or raise objections. This got me a reputation for “not being a team player,” and, I suspect, caused the product team to push back on my promotion. The solution to gaining their trust was to improve my relationship with the product team until they trusted me enough to share their early drafts of their plans and work on them together. Volunteering to do gruntwork involved in planning, like making spreadsheets and so on, went a long way towards solving this problem because it got me involved earlier when it was easier for them to incorporate my feedback.

The product team needed to know that planning could get done better with my help than without it. In this case, it had nothing to do with getting more done or even getting things done better, but rather it was about building trust that I wouldn’t make life more difficult by raising objections at the end of the process.

# The promotion process

Every company of more than a few employees has some sort of policy about promotions. [^smallco] The policy I see most often[^notevery] is some definition of responsibility at each level, and an expectation that the employee works at the next level for some amount of time before being formally promoted. There’s usually some process for applying to get a promotion and some rules about how the application is considered. The thing is, though, the documentation about what each level consists of are often fuzzy, and their exact meaning can be unclear to people who don't have experience with these kinds of documents. What constitutes a “large project” or “deep understanding” or what counts as a “cross-team” project are not always clear.[^competencymatrix]

The ambiguity of these docs is where trust comes in. Nine out of ten times, if you are up for a promotion and you are trusted, you will get it. If you aren’t trusted, you won’t get it. That doesn't mean you can get a promotion you aren't qualified for, or you don't need review teh rubric and follow the rules, but that’s only the evidence that will be used to justify a decision that’s already been made emotionally.

If you don’t get the promotion and the explanation doesn’t make sense to you, think about who does and doesn’t trust you. Figure out a way to win the trust of whoever doesn’t trust you. Think about their goals and what they need from you to meet those goals. Fix that problem and you’ll be a shoe-in next time.

# Sometimes the rules get broken

Admittedly, sometimes it’s not that simple. Sometimes someone gets promoted because the CEO likes them. Sometimes there’s a gap and whoever’s closest just gets it because there isn’t money to hire someone more qualified. In some orgs, people get promoted because they are popular, loyal or were there early. Promotions not based on trust often prove to be mistakes. I remember seeing someone get promoted because of timing and pleasing the CEO, but later came drunk to an important 11am meeting with the company that had just acquired us.

Another problem can be if there’s simply no promotion to be passed over for. Sometimes there just isn’t the opportunity to prove yourself trustworthy on a bigger project. This often happens when a team isn’t growing but individuals are. This can be frustrating if you are very career focused, and might be a signal that it's time to move on, but it can also be a good time to focus more on personal growth.

# Tying in personal growth

Sometimes it can seem like personal development doesn’t help much with professional development. For example, let’s say you want to get better at Python. If your goal is to be more satisfied in your work and enjoy the process of putting a new programming language to use, then getting better at Python might be a worthy thing to focus on. Unless there is a need for more Python expertise or it helps you tackle bigger projects in some way, improving your Python skills may not help your career that much.

So should you bother with that sort of project? That depends on what makes you happier, but if pushing your career forward is an important goal to you, think about how much the company needs your Python skills.

</figure>

As shown in Figure 1, there are things that you want to do to make yourself happy and grow as an individual, and there are things the company needs you to do. The sweet spot is where those things overlap, but that doesn’t always exist – sometimes what you or the company needs is too narrow. The broader your personal development goals are and the more flexible you are about them, the more likely you are to find overlap.

Early in my career, I had very narrow interests in scientific computing and [digital audio](http://localhost:4000/categories/#audio), so instead of getting a job at a company where I’d be asked to things that had nothing to do with digital audio, I did contracting work and only tool on audio projects. As time went on, my interests grew much more flexible and my ambition increased, so now I tend to focus more on the things that will get me promoted. Still, whenever I see an opportunity to do something that will satisfy something personal and professional, I go for it.

# Notes

[^organization]: In this article, when I say "organization", I'm referring to whoever is deciding on your promotion. This might include your boss or head of department, or CEO. It might also include people under you who's feedback is solicited or people you collaborate with in other departments who the deciders listen to. It often includes people with a lot of soft power.

[^smallco]: Some small companies may not have a written policy, and there might be disagreement about what the right policy should be. In this case, do your best to figure out how things are going to work, before going through steps to try and get promoted. This could be an opportunity to write a policy down for the first time.

[^notevery]: My experience is mostly in tech startups. I'm sure other workplaces, like universities, government jobs and so on are different, putting more emphasis on credentials for example.

[^competencymatrix]: Complex "competency matrices" used at some big tech companies are designed to make this as precise as possible, but I've heard stories of these complex rubrics being mostly ignored. I've also seen some real nonsense about exactly what percentage of time people should spend on "tactical" vs "strategic" work to qualify for a promotion, and other attempts to make requirements as exact as possible. I appreciate the attempts to make the process as standardized (and therefore fair) as possible, but the more complex and nuanced it gets the more people ignore the rules, which tends to make the process more biased and unfair, not less.
