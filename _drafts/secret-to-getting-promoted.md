I’ve heard from lawyers that juries decide based on their emotions and use the evidence only to rationalize the verdict. The same thing applies when you are looking to get promoted: first you need to win emotionally, and then supply the proof. In this case, the emotion you must win on is trust.

# Winning trust

Winning trust[^who] might mean many different things: volunteering for bigger projects; creating more visibility for the work you already do; taking on fewer projects but getting them done better; communicating progress better; etc. That's why so much canned advice about getting promoted can be helpful in some situations and not others. For example, you might hear “stay out of office politics” while someone else might tell you “make sure your work is visible”. These pieces of advice are a bit contradictory, so which do you follow? You follow the one that leads to more trust.

For example, if you've quietly done great work but no one knows who you are and what you’ve accomplished, focusing on visibility is probably the right advice, and you probably need to face office politics to get your work seen. On the other hand, if people see you can do great work, but you’re perceived as getting in the way of other projects, you've got a different problem. No one will trust you with your own project if you are getting in the way of theirs, so staying in your lane (and out of office politics) might be better advice.

# The promotion process

Every company of more than a few employees has some sort of policy about promotions.[^smallco] The policy I see most often[^notevery] is some definition of responsibility at each level, and an expectation that the employee works at the next level for some amount of time before being formally promoted (See Figure 1). In this model, a promotion is seen as a recognition of work you are already doing.[^peter]

This is simple enough in principle, but the definitions of each level are often fuzzy, and their exact meaning can be unclear to people who don't have experience with these kinds of documents. What constitutes a “large project” or “deep understanding” or what counts as a “cross-team” project is not always clear.[^competencymatrix]

| Level | Expectation |
| ----- | ----------- |
| L4    | Can lead cross-team projects, handling dependencies and timelines. |
| L3    | Can manage complete medium and large projects from start to finish, getting help from teammates as needed. |
| L2    | Can tackle simple, multi-ticket projects with little ambiguity. Has a deep understanding of their team's core technologies. |
| L1    | Can tackle simple tickets without help. Can handle complex tickets with support from the team. |

_Fig 1 shows a typical, simplified career ladder for engineers. If you are a level 2 and want to be promoted to a level 3, you are often expected to work at level 3 for some amount of time (eg six months) before you actually get the promotion._

While you should read your company's policies and do your best to meet the requirements as you understand them, nine out of ten times, if you are up for a promotion and you are trusted, you will get it. And if you aren’t trusted, you won’t get it. That doesn't mean you can get a promotion you aren't qualified for, or that you don't need to review the rubric and follow the rules. Rather, it means that following the rubric and the rules is only used to justify a decision that’s already been made emotionally.

If you don’t get the promotion and the explanation doesn’t make sense to you, think about who does and doesn’t trust you. Figure out a way to win everyone's trust and you’ll be a shoe-in next time.

# When the rules don't apply

Admittedly, sometimes it’s not that simple. Sometimes someone gets promoted because the CEO likes them. Sometimes there’s a gap and whoever’s closest to filling the gap gets promoted into it. In some orgs, people get promoted because they are popular, loyal or were early employees. Sometimes organizations think about likeability instead of trustworthiness.

Promotions not based on trust often prove to be mistakes. I remember seeing someone get promoted because they had pleased the CEO right around the time an opening appeared. It took a while, but eventually the mistake was obvious to everyone when the promoted employee got drunk while leading an important meeting with the company that had just acquired us.[^meeting]

Other complications happen when there’s simply no promotion available, or if a promotion is possible, but there isn’t the opportunity to prove yourself trustworthy on a bigger project. This sort of thing happens a lot, but is especially common in companies that aren't growing. If developing your career is non-negotiable and you are in this situation, it is a good time to consider moving on. However, it's often a good time to focus more on personal growth instead.

# Notes

[^who]: In this article, I don't say much about who's trust you need to win. That's because it depends a lot on the organization and your particular circumstance, but it usually means a few people, most importantly, your boss. After that, it might include your or head of department, CEO, or other people in power above you. It often also includes anyone who's feedback is solicited or listened to, which usually means people with soft power, who might be in other departments or might even be below you in the org chart.

[^smallco]: Some small companies may not have a written policy, and there might be disagreement about what the right policy should be. In this case, do your best to figure out how things are going to work before going through steps to try and get promoted. This could be an opportunity to write a policy down for the first time.

[^notevery]: My experience is mostly in tech startups. I'm sure other workplaces, like universities, government jobs and so on are different, putting more emphasis on credentials for example.

[^peter]: This model can seem unfair or difficult to navigate if you don't know how to work within the org and get access to the bigger projects. If your manager isn't looking out for you it can get very hairy. However, it does prevent people from [getting promoted into jobs beyond their abilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle).

[^competencymatrix]: Complex "competency matrices" used at some big tech companies are designed to make this as precise as possible, but I've heard stories of these complex rubrics being mostly ignored. I've also seen some real nonsense added to these documents in an apparent attempt to make them more precise. For example, one place I worked laid out exactly what percentage of time people should spend on "tactical" vs "strategic" work to qualify for a promotion. I appreciate attempts to make the process as standardized (and therefore fair) as possible, but the more complex, nuanced (not to mention arbitrary and confusing) it gets the more people ignore the rules, which tends to make the process more biased and unfair, not less.
