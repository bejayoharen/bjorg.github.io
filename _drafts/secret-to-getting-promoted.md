I’ve heard from lawyers that in order to win over juries, it's best to first make an emotional appeal and then supply sufficient evidence to allow the jury to feel justified in their decision. This strategy works because people tend to make decisions based on emotions, not logic. They still need the logic, but logic is not how they make their decision -- it's how they justify the decision they've already made emotionally. The same thing applies when you are looking to get promoted: first you need to win emotionally, and then supply the proof. In this case, the emotion you must win on is trust.

# Gaining trust

Gaining trust[^who] might mean volunteering for bigger projects, or it might mean creating more visibility for the work you already do, or it might mean something else, like taking on fewer projects but getting them done better, or communicating progress better. That's why so much canned advice about getting promoted can be helpful in some situations and not others. For example, you might hear “stay out of office politics” while someone else might tell you “make sure your work is visible”. These pieces of advice are a bit contradictory, so which do you follow? You follow the one that leads to more trust.

For example, if you've quietly done great work but no one knows who you are and what you’ve accomplished, focusing on visibility is probably the right advice, and you probably need to face office politics to get your work seen. On the other hand, if people see your great work, but you’re perceived as getting in other people’s way, you've got a different problem. No one will trust you with your own project if you are getting in the way of theirs, so staying in your lane (and out of office politics) might be better advice.

Some people think gaining trust means convincing your boss that everything is going smoothly. Maybe in some dysfunctional orgs “don’t tell your boss about things going wrong” is good advice, but as a manager, I always want to hear about the problems my reports are having. Even more important, I want to know they are going to resolve it, so they when explaining the problem, they should come prepared with a plan or at least be open to working out a solution with my help. Finding out about a problem later and having to mop it up myself, on the other hand, tells me I can't trust them with the next project, even if the problems were not their fault.

I once worked at a company where the product team was responsible for planning. They would often present a mostly completed plan to engineering and ask for our feedback. What they really wanted, though, was not feedback, but rather for us to rubber stamp their plans. Knowing my team was going to be responsible for implementing much of these plans, I would often ask questions or raise objections. Because this slowed them down, I got a reputation for not being a "team player”.

The more they disliked hearing feedback, the more they tried to ram their plans past me, and the more I protested and brought up objections. Asking my boss to get the Product team to be more collaborative only made the problem worse -- they thought I wasn't being collaborative because I always objected to their plans. In the end, the solution was to improve my relationship with the product team until they trusted me enough to collaborate on the plans. Volunteering to do gruntwork needed for planning, like making spreadsheets and so on, went a long way towards winning back their graces. The gruntwork also got me involved earlier when it was easier for them to incorporate my feedback, and restored their trust that I was trying to help see things through, rather than stop them from planning.

# The promotion process

Every company of more than a few employees has some sort of policy about promotions.[^smallco] The policy I see most often[^notevery] is some definition of responsibility at each level, and an expectation that the employee works at a level above their current level for some amount of time before being formally promoted. (See Figure 1). In this model, a promotion is seen as a recognition of work you are already doing.[^peter]

This is simple enough in principle, but the definitions of each level are often fuzzy, and their exact meaning can be unclear to people who don't have experience with these kinds of documents. What constitutes a “large project” or “deep understanding” or what counts as a “cross-team” project are not always clear.[^competencymatrix]

| Level | Expectation |
| ----- | ----------- |
| L4    | Can lead cross-team projects, handling dependencies and timelines. |
| L3    | Can manage complete medium and large projects from start to finish, getting help from teammates as needed. |
| L2    | Can tackle simple, multi-ticket projects with little ambiguity. Has a deep understanding of their team's core technologies. |
| L1    | Can tackle simple tickets without help. Can handle complex tickets with support from the team. |

_Fig 1 shows a typical, simplified career ladder for engineers. If you are a level 2 and want to be promoted to a level 3, you are often expected to work at level 3 for some amount of time (eg six months) before you actually get the promotion._

While you should read your company's policies and do your best to meet the requirements as you understand them, nine out of ten times, if you are up for a promotion and you are trusted, you will get it. And if you aren’t trusted, you won’t get it. That doesn't mean you can get a promotion you aren't qualified for, or that you don't need to review the rubric and follow the rules. Rather, it means that following the rubric and the rules is only used to justify a decision that’s already been made emotionally.

If you don’t get the promotion and the explanation doesn’t make sense to you, think about who does and doesn’t trust you. Figure out a way to win everyone's trust and you’ll be a shoe-in next time.

# When the rules don't apply

Admittedly, sometimes it’s not that simple. Sometimes someone gets promoted because the CEO likes them. Sometimes there’s a gap and whoever’s closest to filling the gap gets promoted into it. In some orgs, people get promoted because they are popular, loyal or were early employees. Sometimes organizations think about likeability instead of trustworthiness.

Promotions not based on trust often prove to be mistakes. I remember seeing someone get promoted because they had pleased the CEO right around the time an opening appeared. It took a while, but eventually the mistake was obvious to everyone when they got drunk while leading an important meeting with the company that had just acquired us.[^meeting]

Other complications happen when there’s simply no promotion available, or if a promotion is possible, but there isn’t the opportunity to prove yourself trustworthy on a bigger project. This sort of thing happens a lot, but is especially common in companies that aren't growing. If developing your career is non-negotiable and you are in this situation, it is a good time to consider moving on. However, it's often a good time to focus more on personal growth instead.

# Personal growth

Let’s say you want to get better at Python. If your goal is to be more satisfied in your work and enjoy the process of putting a new programming language to use, then getting better at Python might be a worthy thing to focus on. If the company needs more Python expertise or it helps you tackle bigger projects in some way, improving your Python skills may even help your career.

</figure>

But what if your company doesn't even use Python, or doesn't need deep expertise? Should you bother with developing your Python skills? That depends on what makes you happier, but if pushing your career forward is an important goal to you, think about other projects. 

There are things that you want to do to make yourself happy and grow as an individual, and there are things the company needs you to do. The sweet spot is where those overlap, so you can develop personally and professionally. However, overlap doesn’t always exist – sometimes what you want or the company needs is too narrow. The broader your personal development goals are and the more flexible you are about them, the more likely you are to find overlap.

I've seen engineers convince themselves that something has outsized value to the company, when really it's just something they think is cool. It's hard to hear that the thing you poured your heart wasn't appreciated.

Early in my own career, I had very narrow interests in scientific computing and [digital audio](http://localhost:4000/categories/#audio), so instead of getting a job at a company where I’d be asked to do things that had nothing to do with my interests, I worked as a contractor and only took on audio projects. As time went on, my interests grew much more flexible and my ambition increased, so I got a normal job and focused on the things that would get me promoted. Still, whenever I see an opportunity to do something that will satisfy something personal and professional, I go for it, and I've been known to make room for things that don't help my career at all -- it's always good to give your personal interests a little attention now and again.

# Notes

[^who]: In this article, I don't say much about who's trust you need to gain. That's because it depends a lot on the organization and your particular circumstance, but it usually means a few people, most importantly, your boss. After that, it might include your or head of department, CEO, or other people in power above you. It often also includes anyone who's feedback is solicited or listened to, which usually means people with soft power, who might be in other departments or might even be below you in the org chart.

[^smallco]: Some small companies may not have a written policy, and there might be disagreement about what the right policy should be. In this case, do your best to figure out how things are going to work before going through steps to try and get promoted. This could be an opportunity to write a policy down for the first time.

[^notevery]: My experience is mostly in tech startups. I'm sure other workplaces, like universities, government jobs and so on are different, putting more emphasis on credentials for example.

[^peter]: This model can seem unfair or difficult to navigate if you don't know how to work within the org and get access to the bigger projects. If your manager isn't looking out for you it can get very hairy. However, it does prevent people from [getting promoted into jobs beyond their abilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle).

[^competencymatrix]: Complex "competency matrices" used at some big tech companies are designed to make this as precise as possible, but I've heard stories of these complex rubrics being mostly ignored. I've also seen some real nonsense added to these documents in an apparent attempt to make them more precise. For example, one place I worked laid out exactly what percentage of time people should spend on "tactical" vs "strategic" work to qualify for a promotion. I appreciate attempts to make the process as standardized (and therefore fair) as possible, but the more complex, nuanced (not to mention arbitrary and confusing) it gets the more people ignore the rules, which tends to make the process more biased and unfair, not less.
